CHANGES IN TIMP VERSION 1.1

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o The "fitModel" function no longer takes a list "opt" as an argument to
      specify fitting/plotting options.  Instead, the argument "opt" to
      "fitModel" is an instance of class "opt", which currently has subclasses
      "kinopt" and "specopt", the slots of which give the fitting/plotting
      options for models of class "kin" and "spec", respectively.

    o When multiple datasets involving different ranges of wavelengths
      and times are fit with a kinetic model, plots of results are 
      over the full range of wavelengths and times.

    o If the option "selectedtraces" is given in the "opt" list of "fitModel", 
      only the selected traces are plotted, whereas previousely a plot of 
      both the selected traces and the full set of traces was given.
