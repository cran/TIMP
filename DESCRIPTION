Description: A problem solving environment (PSE) for fitting separable
    nonlinear models to measurements arising in physics and chemistry
    experiments, as described by Mullen & van Stokkum (2007)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v018.i03> for its use in fitting time resolved
    spectroscopy data, and as described by Laptenok et al. (2007)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v018.i08> for its use in fitting Fluorescence
    Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) data, in the study of FÃ¶rster
    Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).  `TIMP` also serves as the
    computation backend for the `GloTarAn` software, a graphical user
    interface for the package, as described in Snellenburg et al. (2012)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v049.i03>.
